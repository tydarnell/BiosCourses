Cancer immunotherapy is a powerful, growing treatment approach to cancer that canbe combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and oncosurgery. Modulating theimmune system to enhance anticancer response by several strategies has yieldedimproved cancer survival. Despite this progress, the success rate forimmunotherapy has been below expectations due to unpredictable efficacy andoff-target side effects from systemic dosing. Nanotechnology offers numerousdifferent materials and targeting properties to overcome many of these challengesin immunotherapy. In this chapter, we review current immunotherapy and itschallenges as well as the latest nanotechnology applications in cancerimmunotherapy.
