Compared with men of other races andethnicities, African-American men have higher rates of mortality and morbidityfrom chronic illness and diseases including cancer, heart disease, prostatecancer, diabetes and HIV/AIDS. One way to address these disparities is to includeAfrican-American men in health research, to elicit their perspectives on healthrisks and protective factors. These can then inform interventions aimed atreducing health disparities.
