Most ovarian cancer patients respond well to initial platinum-based chemotherapy.However, within a year, many patients experience disease recurrence with aplatinum resistant phenotype that responds poorly to second line chemotherapies.As a result, new strategies to address platinum resistant ovarian cancer (PROC)are needed. Herein, we report that NP co-delivery of cisplatin (CP) andwortmannin (Wtmn), a DNA repair inhibitor, synergistically enhanceschemoradiotherapy (CRT) and reverses CP resistance in PROC. We encapsulated thisregimen in FDA approved poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)(PLGA-PEG) NPs to reduce systemic side effects, enhance cellular CP uptake,improve Wtmn stability, and increase therapeutic efficacy. Treatment ofplatinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC) and PROC murine models with thesedual-drug loaded NPs (DNPs) significantly reduced tumor burden versus treatmentwith combinations of free drugs or single-drug loaded NPs (SNPs). These resultssupport further investigation of this NP-based, synergistic drug regimen as ameans to combat PROC in the clinic.
