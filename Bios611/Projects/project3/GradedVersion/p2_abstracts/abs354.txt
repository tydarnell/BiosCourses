Radiation therapy (RT) plays an important role in the management of breastcancer. Radiation-induced fibrosis is a side effect of radiation therapy and mayoccur in up to 13% of the cases in patients (Radiother Oncol, 2009;90:80),fortunately usually is modest/localized and not associated with marked symptoms.However, occasionally, fibrosis can be moderate-to-severe, and causeclinically-meaningful symptoms. The current review summarizes the use ofpentoxifylline and vitamin E of treatment or prevention of radiation-inducedfibrosis in breast cancer patients. Even though data are limited, this regimenmay reduce RT-associated toxicity.
