Despite major advancements in cancer treatments, there are still many limitationsto therapy including off-target effects, drug resistance, and control ofcancer-related symptoms. There are opportunities for local drug delivery devicesto intervene at various stages of cancer to provide curative and palliativebenefit. Iontophoretic devices that deliver drugs locally to a region of interesthave been adapted for the treatment of cancer. These devices have shown promisein pre-clinical and clinical studies for retinoblastoma, skin, bladder, andpancreatic cancers. Herein, we review iontophoretic devices used in themanagement of cancer.
