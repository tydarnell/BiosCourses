Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination could prevent mostHPV-associated cancers, but few U.S. adolescents are vaccinated according toguidelines. To inform efforts to counsel parents more effectively, we sought toquantify their views on the best and worst reasons for guideline-consistent HPVvaccination. We hypothesized that parents' views would differ according to theirvaccination confidence.Methods: We developed a best-worst scaling experiment toevaluate 11 reasons healthcare providers commonly give for HPV vaccination. Theinstrument was administered in 2016 via a national online survey to 1,177 parentsof adolescents. Parents completed 11 choice tasks of 5 reasons each, indicatingthe best and worst reason in each task. We used conditional logistic regressionto rank reasons for the sample overall and by vaccination confidence(low/high).Results: Parents viewed cancer prevention as the best reason for HPVvaccination (P < 0.001). Other commonly endorsed reasons were preventing a commoninfection, having lasting benefits, or being a safe vaccine (all P < 0.001).Reasons viewed as worst were: It is a scientific breakthrough; I got it for myown child; and your child is due (all P < 0.001). Stratified analyses indicatedsmall differences in how often parents with low versus high vaccinationconfidence endorsed messages (P < 0.001), but the two groups ranked reasonssimilarly overall.Conclusions: Parents prioritized cancer prevention as the bestreason for guideline-consistent HPV vaccination. Several other common reasons,including having vaccinated one's own child, may warrant additionaltesting.Impact: Providers should emphasize cancer prevention when discussing HPVvaccination, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,the President's Cancer Panel, and others.
