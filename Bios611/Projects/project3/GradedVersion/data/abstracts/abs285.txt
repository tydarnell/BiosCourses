In a recent Cell Reports article, Li et al. report that obesity is associatedwith altered fatty acid metabolism and DNA methylation in the colonic epithelium,which precede a tumor-prone gene-expression profile. Interestingly,obesity-associated methylation and transcriptome changes were reversed by weightloss, and the duration of weight loss correlated with the extent of restored geneexpression. These findings have implications that are encouraging for weight lossand cancer prevention.
