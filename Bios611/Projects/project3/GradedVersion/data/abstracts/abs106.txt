BACKGROUND: Adding modified FOLFOX6 (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin)after chemoradiotherapy and lengthening the chemoradiotherapy-to-surgery intervalis associated with an increase in the proportion of rectal cancer patients with apathological complete response.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze disease-free and overallsurvival.DESIGN: This was a nonrandomized phase II trial.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at multiple institutions.PATIENTS: Four sequential study groups with stage II or III rectal cancer wereincluded.INTERVENTION: All of the patients received 50 Gy of radiation with concurrentcontinuous infusion of fluorouracil for 5 weeks. Patients in each group received0, 2, 4, or 6 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 after chemoradiation and before totalmesorectal excision. Patients were recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapyafter surgery to complete a total of 8 cycles of modified FOLFOX6.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The trial was powered to detect differences inpathological complete response, which was reported previously. Disease-free andoverall survival are the main outcomes for the current study.RESULTS: Of 259 patients, 211 had a complete follow-up. Median follow-up was 59months (range, 9-125 mo). The mean number of total chemotherapy cycles differedamong the 4 groups (p = 0.002), because one third of patients in the groupassigned to no preoperative FOLFOX did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy.Disease-free survival was significantly associated with study group, ypTNM stage,and pathological complete response (p = 0.004, <0.001, and 0.001). A secondaryanalysis including only patients who received â‰¥1 cycle of FOLFOX still showeddifferences in survival between study groups (p = 0.03).LIMITATIONS: The trial was not randomized and was not powered to show differencesin survival. Survival data were not available for 19% of the patients.CONCLUSIONS: Adding modified FOLFOX6 after chemoradiotherapy and before totalmesorectal excision increases compliance with systemic chemotherapy anddisease-free survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.Neoadjuvant consolidation chemotherapy may have benefits beyond increasingpathological complete response rates.
