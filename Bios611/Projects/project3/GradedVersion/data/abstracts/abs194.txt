BACKGROUND: A few papers have considered reproducibility of a posteriori dietarypatterns across populations, as well as pattern associations with head and neckcancer risk when multiple populations are available.METHODS: We used individual-level pooled data from seven case-control studies(3,844 cases; 6,824 controls) participating in the International Head and NeckCancer Epidemiology consortium. We simultaneously derived shared andstudy-specific a posteriori patterns with a novel approach called multi-studyfactor analysis applied to 23 nutrients. We derived odds ratios (ORs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx combined,and larynx, from logistic regression models.RESULTS: We identified three shared patterns that were reproducible acrossstudies (75% variance explained): the Anti-oxidant vitamins and fiber (OR=0.57,CI: 0.41-0.78, highest vs. lowest score quintile) and the Fats (OR=0.80, CI:0.67-0.95) patterns were inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancerrisk. The Animal products and cereals (OR=1.5, CI: 1.1-2.1) and the Fats (OR=1.8,CI: 1.4-2.3) patterns were positively associated with laryngeal cancer risk,whereas a linear inverse trend in laryngeal cancer risk was evident for theAnti-oxidant vitamins and fiber pattern. We also identified four additionalstudy-specific patterns, one for each of the four US studies examined. We namedthem all as Dairy products and breakfast cereals and two were associated withoral and pharyngeal cancer risk.CONCLUSION: Multi-study factor analysis provides insight into patternreproducibility, and supports previous evidence on cross-country reproducibilityof dietary patterns and on their association with head and neck cancer risk.
