BACKGROUND: Many studies have examined long-term outcomes after childhood cancer,but few address outcomes for adolescent and young adult (AYA; those aged 15-39years) cancer survivors. Conditional survival reflects changing mortality riskwith time since cancer diagnosis and is a useful measure for planning long-termfollow-up care.METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry 9database, the authors identified a cohort of AYA patients diagnosed with a firstmalignant cancer between 1973 and 2009 and followed through 2014. They estimated5-year relative survival at the time of diagnosis and at each additional yearsurvived up to 25 years after diagnosis, conditional on the individual beingalive at the beginning of that year.RESULTS: A total of 205,954 AYA patients with cancer were identified. Thyroidcancer, melanoma, testicular cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, andcentral nervous system (CNS) tumors comprised 67% of all cancers. For all cancerscombined, 5-year relative survival was 84.5% (95% confidence interval,84.3%-84.7%) at 1 year after diagnosis and 94.0% (95% CI, 93.9%-94.2%) at 5years. The relative survival first exceeded 95%, reflecting minimal excessmortality compared with the general population, at 7 years. Patients with thyroidcancer, testicular cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer reached a relativesurvival of >95% at the time of diagnosis and at 1, 3, and 18 years afterdiagnosis, respectively. Estimates for those with Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemiawere >95% at 6 and 13 years, respectively, but declined to <95% at 20 years. AYAindividuals with CNS tumors did not reach 95% by 25 years after diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: For AYA survivors of breast cancer, CNS tumors, and hematologicmalignancies, long-term excess mortality should be considered when planningfollow-up care.
