Although cancer immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors holds greatpromise toward many types of cancers, several challenges still remain, associatedwith low objective response of patient rate as well as systemic side effects.Here, a combination immunotherapy strategy is developed based on a thermogellingreactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive polypeptide gel for sustained release ofanti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 antibody and dextro-1-methyl tryptophan,inhibitor of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase with leveraging the ROS level in thetumor microenvironment. This bioresponsive gel depot can effectively reduce thelocal ROS level and facilitate release of immunotherapeutics, which leads toenhanced anti-melanoma efficacy in vivo.
