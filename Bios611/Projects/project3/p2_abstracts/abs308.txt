OBJECTIVE: This study assessed patient-centered communication (PCC) among newlydiagnosed colorectal cancer patients. PCC, a key part of patient-centered care,contributes directly and indirectly to health-related quality of life,satisfaction with care, and other outcomes.METHODS: We conducted a survey of patients in North Carolina, using atheoretically-based and validated measure that provides an overall PCC score andsubscale scores for six PCC functions.RESULTS: A total of 501 patients participated. The highest scores were for thePCC functions of Fostering Healing Relationships, Exchanging Information, andMaking Decisions. The lowest scores were for the functions of ManagingUncertainty and Enabling Self-Management, yet these were functions respondentsrated as most important. Respondents who thought about more than one healthprofessional (versus oncologist) reported better communication. PCC also variedby treatment type, mental and physical health status, age, race, and education.CONCLUSION: Most patients reported good communication overall, however patientsin poor physical health and mental health reported worse communication. Thequality of communication varied across the PCC functions.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health professionals need to use a PCC approach thatbuilds trust, respects the patient, provides salient information that patientscan understand, provides emotional support, and facilitates the patient'sengagement in care.
