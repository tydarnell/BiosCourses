Drug resistance remains a formidable challenge to cancer therapy. P-glycoprotein(Pgp) contributes to multidrug resistance in numerous cancers by preventingaccumulation of anticancer drugs in cancer cells. Strategies to overcome thisresistance have been vigorously sought for over 3 decades, yet clinical solutionsdo not exist. The main reason for the failure is lack of cancer specificity ofsmall-molecule Pgp inhibitors, thus causing severe toxicity in normal tissues. Inthis study, Pgp-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) was developed to achievesuperior cancer specificity through antibody targeting plus locoregional lightactivation. Thus, a Pgp monoclonal antibody was chemically modified with IR700, aporphyrin photosensitizer. In vitro studies showed that theantibody-photosensitizer conjugates specifically bind to Pgp-expressing drugresistant cancer cells, and caused dramatic cytotoxicity upon irradiation with anear infrared light. We then tested our Pgp-targeted approach in mouse xenograftmodels of chemoresistant ovarian cancer and head and neck cancer. In both models,targeted PDT produced rapid tumor shrinkage, and significantly prolonged survivalof tumor-bearing mice. We conclude that our targeted PDT approach producesmolecularly targeted and spatially selective ablation of chemoresistant tumors,and thereby provides an effective approach to overcome Pgp-mediated multidrugresistance in cancer, where conventional approaches have failed.
