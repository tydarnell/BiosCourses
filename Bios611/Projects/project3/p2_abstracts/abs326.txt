CONTEXT: Management of bladder cancer (BC) is primarily driven by stage, grade,and biological potential. Knowledge of each is derived using clinical,histopathological, and radiological investigations. This multimodal approachreduces the risk of error from one particular test, but may present a stagingdilemma when results conflict. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)may improve patient care through imaging of the bladder with better resolution ofthe tissue planes than computed tomography and without radiation exposure.OBJECTIVE: To define a standardized approach to imaging and reporting mpMRI forBC, by developing a VI-RADS score.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We created VI-RADS (Vesical Imaging-Reporting And DataSystem) through consensus using existing literature.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We describe standard imaging protocols and reporting criteria(including size, location, multiplicity, and morphology) for bladder mpMRI. Wepropose a five-point VI-RADS score, derived using T2-weighted MRI,diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast enhancement, which suggests therisks of muscle invasion. We include sample images used to understand VI-RADS.CONCLUSIONS: We hope that VI-RADS will standardize reporting, facilitatecomparisons between patients, and in future years, will be tested and refined ifnecessary. While we do not advocate mpMRI for all patients with BC, this imagingmay compliment pathology or reduce radiation-based imaging. Bladder mpMRI may bemost useful in patients with non-muscle-invasive cancers, in expediting radicaltreatment or for determining response to bladder-sparing approaches.PATIENT SUMMARY: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for bladder cancer arebecoming more common and may provide accurate information that helps improvepatient care. Here, we describe a standardized reporting criterion for bladderMRI. This should improve communication between doctors and allow bettercomparisons between patients.
