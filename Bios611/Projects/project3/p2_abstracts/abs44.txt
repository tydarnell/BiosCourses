BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous studies reported an association of the bacteriaHelicobacter pylori, the primary cause of gastric cancer, and risk of colorectalcancer (CRC). However, these findings have been inconsistent, appear to vary withpopulation characteristics, and may be specific for virulence factor VacA. Tomore thoroughly evaluate the potential association of H pylori antibodies withCRC risk, we assembled a large consortium of cohorts representing diversepopulations in the United States.METHODS: We used H pylori multiplex serologic assays to analyze serum samplesfrom 4063 incident cases of CRC, collected before diagnosis, and 4063 matchedindividuals without CRC (controls) from 10 prospective cohorts for antibodyresponses to 13 H pylori proteins, including virulence factors VacA and CagA. Theassociation of sero-positivity to H pylori proteins, as well as protein-specificantibody level, with odds of CRC was determined by conditional logisticregression.RESULTS: Overall 40% of controls and 41% of cases were H. pylori sero-positive(odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.99-1.20). H pylori VacA-specificsero-positivity was associated with an 11% increased odds of CRC (OR, 1.11; 95%CI, 1.01-1.22), and this association was particularly strong among AfricanAmericans (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08-1.95). Additionally, odds of CRC increased withlevel of VacA antibody in the overall cohort (P=.008) and specifically amongAfrican Americans (P=.007).CONCLUSION: In an analysis of a large consortium of cohorts representing diversepopulations, we found serologic responses to H pylori VacA to associate withincreased risk of CRC risk-particularly for African Americans. Future studiesshould seek to understand whether this marker is related to virulent H pyloristrains carried in these populations.
