These years, transformable drug delivery systems (DDSs), which hold thecapability of changing formulation morphology and subsequent functionality at thedesired disease site, have shown great promise in control of spatio-temporal drugdelivery/release manner and enhanced treatment efficacy. Equipped withcontrollability and design flexibility, the transformable DDSs are beingincreasingly pursued for the development of precision drug delivery platforms forbiomedical applications. In this review, we describe the recently developedintracelluarly and extracellularly transformable DDSs, especially associated withassembly or disassociation of the original formulation units, for achievingvarious functionalities, including prolonged retention time, inhibitedendocytosis and enhanced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the different stimuli, suchas pH, enzyme, light, temperature, redox and mechanical force that trigger thetransformation process are also introduced. The future outlook and challenges arediscussed in the end.
