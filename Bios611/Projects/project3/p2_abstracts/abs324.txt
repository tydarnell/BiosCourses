Gene expression profiling has had a considerable impact on our understandingofbreastcancer biology. Duringthelast decade, 4 intrinsic molecular subtypes ofbreast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched [HER2-E] and Basal-like) havebeen identified and intensively studied. In this article, we review and discussthe clinical implications of the 2 non-luminal subtypes (i.e. HER2-E andBasal-like) identified within hormone receptor (HR)-positive disease. Afterreviewing 32 studies for a total of 13,091 samples, ∼8% and ∼ 15% of early andmetastatic HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer, respectively, were found to benon-luminal. Clinically, HR+/HER2-negative/non-luminal subtypes have beenassociated with estrogen independence, chemo-sensitivity, resistance to CDK4/6inhibition and poor outcome. Interestingly, EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitionmight be of value in the HR+/HER2-negative/HER2-E subtype. Finally, the HER2-Esubtype within HR+/HER2 + disease represents ∼ 30% and has been associated withanti-HER2 sensitivity, chemo-sensitivity and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition. Inthe upcoming years, retrospective and prospective clinical trials evaluating bothbiomarkers should lead to improvements in patient outcomes.
