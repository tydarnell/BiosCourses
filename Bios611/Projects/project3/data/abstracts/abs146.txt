Cancer-derived loss-of-function mutations in the KEAP1 tumor suppressor genestabilize the NRF2 transcription factor, resulting in a pro-survival geneexpression program that alters cellular metabolism and neutralizes oxidativestress. In a recent genotype-phenotype study, we classified 40% of KEAP1mutations as ANCHOR mutants. By immunoprecipitation, these mutants bind more NRF2than wild-type KEAP1 and ubiquitylate NRF2, but are incapable of promoting NRF2degradation. BioID-based protein interaction studies confirmed increasedabundance of NRF2 within the KEAP1 ANCHOR mutant complexes with no otherstatistically significant changes to the complexes. Discrete molecular dynamicsimulation modeling and limited proteolysis suggest that the ANCHOR mutationsstabilize residues in KEAP1 that contact NRF2. The modeling supports anintramolecular salt bridge between the R470C ANCHOR mutation and E493; mutationof the E493 residue confirmed the model, resulting in the ANCHOR phenotype. Inlive cells, the KEAP1 R320Q and R470C ANCHOR mutants co-localize with NRF2,p62/SQSTM1, and polyubiquitin in structured spherical droplets that rapidly fuseand dissolve. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with confocal fluorescentimaging revealed membraneless phase-separated biomolecular condensates. Wepresent a model wherein ANCHOR mutations form p62-dependent biomolecularcondensates that may represent a transitional state between impaired proteasomaldegradation and autophagy.
