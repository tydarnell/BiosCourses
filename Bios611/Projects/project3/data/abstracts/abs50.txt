BACKGROUND: Telehealth employs technology to connect patients to the righthealthcare resources at the right time. Women are high utilizers of healthcarewith gender-specific health issues that may benefit from the convenience andpersonalization of telehealth. Thus, we produced an evidence map describing thequantity, distribution, and characteristics of evidence assessing theeffectiveness of telehealth services designed for women.METHODS: We searched MEDLINE® (via PubMed®) and Embase® from inception throughMarch 20, 2018. We screened systematic reviews (SRs), randomized trials, andquasi-experimental studies using predetermined eligibility criteria. Articlesmeeting inclusion criteria were identified for data abstraction. To assessemerging trends, we also conducted a targeted search of ClinicalTrials.gov .RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four primary studies and three SRs were eligible forabstraction. We grouped studies into focused areas of research: maternal health(n = 96), prevention (n = 46), disease management (n = 63), family planning(n = 9), high-risk breast cancer assessment (n = 10), intimate partner violence(n = 7), and mental health (n = 3). Most interventions focused on phone as theprimary telehealth modality and featured healthcare team-to-patient communicationand were limited in duration (e.g., < 12 weeks). Few interventions were conductedwith older women (≥ 60 years) or in racially/ethnically diverse populations.There are few SRs in this area and limited evidence regarding newer telehealthmodalities such as mobile-based applications or short message service/texting.Targeted search of clinical.trials.gov yielded 73 ongoing studies that show ashift in the use of non-telephone modalities.DISCUSSION: Our systematic evidence map highlights gaps in the existingliterature, such as a lack of studies in key women's health areas (intimatepartner violence, mental health), and a dearth of relevant SRs. With few existingSRs in this literature, there is an opportunity for examining effects,efficiency, and acceptability across studies to inform efforts at implementingtelehealth for women.
