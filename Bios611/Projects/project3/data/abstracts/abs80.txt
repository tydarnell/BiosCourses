Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are key physiologicsuppressors of the cytotoxic immune reaction. However, to date, the combinationof PD1/PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) andantigen-presenting cells has been only minimally reported in breast carcinoma, inparticular in relation to HER2-positive cases. The goal of this study was toevaluate both cellular tumoral immune reaction and PD-L1/PD1 distribution inHER2-positive cases, as well as any associations with clinical outcome usingconventional chemotherapy combined with HER2 blocking. Multicolorimmunohistochemical multiplex assays simultaneously demonstrating PD1, PD-L1, andCD8 or PD-L1, CD3, and CD163 were performed on tissue microarrays (TMA)representing 216 pretreatment cases of HER2-positive invasive breast carcinoma.PD-L1 expression was identified in 38 cases (18%), including 12 cases (6%) withPD-L1 labeling of tumor cells and 26 cases (12%) with PD-L1 labeling of immunecells only. Ten of 12 cases with PD-L1 staining of tumor cells showed staining ofassociated immune cells as well. With this assay method, PD1 was detectable inmany fewer cases (6 cases or 3%). PD-L1 expression was positively associated withhigh Nottingham grade, negative ER and PR, the absence of lymph node metastasis,and high levels of CD8+ cells. The overall survival by univariate analysis waspositively associated with lower tumor stage, the absence of lymph nodemetastasis, PD-L1 expression, and high levels of CD8+ cells. Therefore, our datasuggest cytotoxic immune reaction mediated by CD8-positive T cells and PD-L1expression may predict a better outcome in patients with HER2-positive breastcarcinoma managed with conventional chemotherapy and HER2-blocking therapy. Thesefindings recommend clinical trials utilizing checkpoint blocking immunotherapy insome form for HER2-positive breast cancer.
