Polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification thatgoverns protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinctpolyubiquitin linkages ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). Weexplored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Usingin vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitinchains with the Lys63 (K63) linkage bound to DNA through a motif we called the"DNA-interacting patch" (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr9,Lys11, and Glu34 Upon DNA damage, the binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin chainsto DNA enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction withan Ile44 patch in ubiquitin to facilitate DNA repair. Furthermore, experimentalor cancer patient-derived mutations within the DIP impaired the DNA bindingcapacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-linked polyubiquitin chainaccumulation at sites of DNA damage, thereby resulting in defective DNA repairand increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Our results thereforehighlight a critical physiological role for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains inbinding to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair.
