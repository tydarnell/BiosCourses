The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase andkey regulator of cell cycle progression. Since APC/C promotes the degradation ofmitotic cyclins, it controls cell cycle-dependent oscillations incyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Both CDKs and APC/C control a largenumber of substrates and are regulated by analogous mechanisms, includingcofactor-dependent activation. However, whereas substrate dephosphorylation isknown to counteract CDK, it remains largely unknown whether deubiquitinatingenzymes (DUBs) antagonize APC/C substrate ubiquitination during mitosis. Here, wedemonstrate that Cezanne/OTUD7B is a cell cycle-regulated DUB that opposes theubiquitination of APC/C targets. Cezanne is remarkably specific for K11-linkedubiquitin chains, which are formed by APC/C in mitosis. Accordingly, Cezannebinds established APC/C substrates and reverses their APC/C-mediatedubiquitination. Cezanne depletion accelerates APC/C substrate degradation andcauses errors in mitotic progression and formation of micronuclei. These datahighlight the importance of tempered APC/C substrate destruction in maintainingchromosome stability. Furthermore, Cezanne is recurrently amplified andoverexpressed in numerous malignancies, suggesting a potential role in genomemaintenance and cancer cell proliferation.
