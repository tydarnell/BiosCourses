OBJECTIVES: To analyze self-reported changes in physical function in older womenwith breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 49907prospective randomized clinical trial.SETTING: CALGB institutions in the United States.PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 65 and older with Stage I to III breast cancer enrolledin CALGB 49907 who had physical function data from before and after receipt ofadjuvant chemotherapy (N=256; mean age 71.5, range 65-85).MEASUREMENTS: Participants were administered the physical function subscale ofthe European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of LifeQuestionnaire before chemotherapy, at the end of chemotherapy, and 12 monthsafter chemotherapy initiation. Functional decline was defined as a more than10-point decrease from baseline at each time point. Resilience was defined asreturn to within 10 points of baseline. Multivariable regression was used toexamine pretreatment characteristics associated with physical function changes.RESULTS: Of 42% of participants who had physical function decline from before tothe end of chemotherapy, 47% recovered by 12 months (were resilient). Almostone-third experienced functional decline from before chemotherapy to 12 monthslater. Pretreatment fatigue was a risk factor for functional decline from beforeto the end of chemotherapy (P=.02). Risk factors for functional decline at 12months included pretreatment dyspnea (P=.007) and being unmarried (P=.01).CONCLUSION: Functional decline was common in older women receiving adjuvantchemotherapy for breast cancer in a clinical trial. Although half recovered theirphysical function, one-third had a clinically meaningful decline at 12 months.Strategies are needed to prevent functional decline in older adults receivingchemotherapy.
