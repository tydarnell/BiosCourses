BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trialdemonstrated equivalent survival in early-stage breast cancer (BC) patientsreceiving either axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel lymph nodedissection (SLND) alone. However, institutional studies have called into questionthe generalization of these findings outside of a clinical trial.METHODS: Early-stage BC patients diagnosed in 2013, that received lumpectomy withwhole-breast irradiation, and underwent either ALND or SLND alone, in NationalCancer Database were included. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate45-month survival, accounting for demographics, comorbidities, insurance type,cancer and neighborhood characteristics.RESULTS: 62,184 patients were included, of which 21,892 (35%) underwent ALND.Patients undergoing ALND, compared to SLND, appeared to have slightly lowersurvival (91.4% vs 95.1%); moreover, even after weighting, a small differencepersisted (92.7% vs 94.7%, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97, 0.99).CONCLUSIONS: SLND is a safe and effective alternative to ALND in BC patients withlimited nodal involvement. This study provides additional evidence that thefindings of ACOSOG Z0011 are applicable to the larger early-stage BC population.
