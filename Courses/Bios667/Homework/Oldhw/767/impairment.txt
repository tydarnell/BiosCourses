Description:

In a study of mental health conducted on a random sample of 40 adult residents of Alachua County, Florida,
mental impairment was measured on a 4-level ordinal scale with 4 categories (well, mild symptom formation, moderate
symptom formation, impaired). 
A goal of the study was to relate mental impairment to several covariates, including an index of life events and 
socio-economic status (SES). The life events (LE) index is a composite measure of the number and severity of important life
events that occurred within the past three years (e.g., birth of a child, new job, divorce, death of a family member). 
SES is measured as binary (low, high).

 
Variable List:

Subject ID, Life Events, SES (0=low, 1=high), Mental impairment (1=well, 2=mild symptom formation, 3=moderate
symptom formation, 4=impaired).
