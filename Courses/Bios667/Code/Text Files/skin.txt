Description:

The data are from the Skin Cancer Prevention Study, a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial of beta-carotene to prevent non-melanoma skin
cancer in high risk subjects. A total of 1805 subjects were randomized to either
placebo or 50mg of beta-carotene per day for 5 years. Subjects were examined 
once a year and biopsied if a cancer was suspected to determine the number of 
new skin cancers occurring since the last exam. The outcome variable is a count
of the number of new skin cancers per year. 
The outcome variable Y is a count of the of the number of new skin cancers per 
year. The categorical variable Treatment is coded 1=beta-carotene, 0=placebo. 
The variable Year denotes the year of follow-up. The categorical variable Gender
is coded 1=male, 0=female. The categorical variable Skin denotes skin type and 
is coded 1=burns, 0=otherwise. The variable Exposure is a count of the number 
of previous skin cancers. The variable Age is the age (in years) of each 
subject at randomization.
Complete data are available on 1683 subjects comprising a total of 7081 measurements.
