Description:

The data are from the Muscatine Coronary Risk Factor (MCRF) study, 
a longitudinal survey  of school-age children in Muscatine, Iowa.
The MCRF study had the goal of examining the development and
persistence of risk factors for coronary disease in children.
In the MCRF study, weight and height measurements of five cohorts of children,
initially aged 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, and 13-15 years, were
obtained biennially from 1977 to 1981. Data were collected on 4856
boys and girls. On the basis of a comparison of their weight to
age-gender specific norms, children were classified as obese or
not obese.
