Description:

The data are from a randomized, double-blind, study of AIDS patients with 
advanced immune suppression (CD4 counts of less than or equal to 50 cells/mm^3).
Patients in AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) Study 193A were randomized to 
dual or triple combinations of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors. 
Specifically, patients were randomized to one of four daily regimens containing
600mg of zidovudine: zidovudine alternating monthly with 400mg didanosine;
zidovudine plus 2.25mg of zalcitabine; zidovudine plus 400mg of didanosine; 
or zidovudine plus 400mg of didanosine plus 400mg of nevirapine (triple therapy). 
Measurements of CD4 counts were scheduled to be collected at baseline and at 
8-week intervals during follow-up. However, the CD4 count data are unbalanced 
due to mistimed measurements and missing data that resulted from skipped visits
and dropout. The number of measurements of CD4 counts during the first 40 
weeks of follow-up varied from 1 to 9, with a median of 4. 
The response variable is the log transformed CD4 counts, log(CD4 counts + 1), 
available on 1309 patients.
The categorical variable Treatment is coded 1 = zidovudine alternating monthly 
with 400mg didanosine, 2 = zidovudine plus 2.25mg of zalcitabine, 3 = zidovudine
plus 400mg of didanosine, and 4 = zidovudine plus 400mg of didanosine plus 
400mg of nevirapine. The variable Week represents time since baseline (in weeks).


Variable List: Subject ID, Treatment, Age (years), Gender (1=M, 0=F), Week, log(CD4 count + 1).
