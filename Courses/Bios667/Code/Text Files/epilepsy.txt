Description:

The data are from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of 59 epileptics.
Patients with partial seizures were enrolled in a randomized
clinical trial of the anti-epileptic drug, progabide. Participants
in the study were randomized to either progabide or a placebo, as
an adjuvant to the standard anti-epileptic chemotherapy. Progabide
is an anti-epileptic drug whose primary mechanism of action is to
enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content; GABA is the
primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.
Prior to receiving treatment, baseline data on the number of
epileptic seizures during the preceding 8-week interval were
recorded. Counts of epileptic seizures during  2-week intervals
before each of four successive post-randomization clinic visits
were recorded.
