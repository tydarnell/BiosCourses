Description: 

The Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children (TLC) trial was a placebo-controlled, 
randomized study of succimer (a chelating agent) in children with blood 
lead levels of 20-44 micrograms/dL.
These data consist of four repeated measurements of blood lead 
levels obtained at baseline (or week 0), week 1, week 4, and 
week 6 on 100 children who were randomly assigned to chelation treatment 
with succimer or placebo.


Variable List: 

Each row of the data set contains the following 6 variables:

ID, Treatment Group, Lead Level Week 0, Lead Level Week 1, 
Lead Level Week 4, Lead Level Week 6.
