Description:

In a U.S. Centers for Disease Control study, conducted in the state of Georgia from 1980 to 1992, linked data 
on live births to the same mother were obtained (Adams et al., 1997). This dataset contains a subset of data 
restricted to 878 mothers for whom five births were identified.  
The main variables of interest are maternal age (the mother's age at each birth) and infant birth weight. 
Note that because each mother had five infant births, but at different maternal ages, maternal age is a within-subject 
or time-varying covariate.

Variable List: 
Mother ID, Birth Order, Birth Weight (in grams), Maternal Age (years), Child ID
