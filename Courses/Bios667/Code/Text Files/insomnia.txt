In a clinical trial of patients with insomnia (Francom, Chuang-Stein and Landis, 1989), patients were randomized to receive either a
hypnotic drug or placebo.An ordinal response, denoting patients' reported time (in minutes) to fall asleep after going to bed
was recorded at baseline and after two weeks of treatment. The four-level ordinal response is coded 
1: < 20 minutes, 2: 20-30 minutes, 3: 30-60 minutes, 4: > 60 minutes.
