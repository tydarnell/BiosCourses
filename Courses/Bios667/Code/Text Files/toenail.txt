Description:

The data are from a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter
study comparing two oral antifungal treatments (Itraconazole and Terbinafine)
for toe-nail infection. Patients were evaluated for the degree of onycholysis
(the degree of separation of the nail plate from the nail-bed) at baseline 
(week 0) and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 thereafter. The onycholysis 
outcome variable is binary (none or mild versus moderate or severe). The
binary outcome was evaluated on 294 patients comprising a total of
1908 measurements. 

The variable Month denotes the exact timing of measurements in
months. The variable Visit denotes the visit number (visit numbers
1-7 correspond to scheduled visits at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and
48 weeks).


Variable List: Subject ID, Response (0=none or mild, 1=moderate or severe), 
Treatment (0=Itraconazole, 1=Terbinafine), Month, Visit.
