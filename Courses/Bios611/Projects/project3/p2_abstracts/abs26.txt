Importance: Colorectal cancer screening (CRC) is recommended by all major USmedical organizations but remains underused.Objective: To identify interventions associated with increasing CRC screeningrates and their effect sizes.Data Sources: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature,the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January 1, 1996,to August 31, 2017. Key search terms included colorectal cancer and screening.Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of US-based interventions in clinicalsettings designed to improve CRC screening test completion in average-riskadults.Data Extraction and Synthesis: At least 2 investigators independently extracteddata and appraised each study's risk of bias. Where sufficient data wereavailable, random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain either a pooled riskratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) for screening completion for each type ofintervention.Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was completion of CRC screening.Examination included interventions to increase completion of (1) initial CRCscreening by any recommended modality, (2) colonoscopy after an abnormal initialscreening test result, and (3) continued rounds of annual fecal blood tests(FBTs).Results: The main review included 73 randomized clinical trials comprising366â€¯766 patients at low or medium risk of bias. Interventions that wereassociated with increased CRC screening completion rates compared with usual careincluded FBT outreach (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.81-2.81; RD, 22%; 95% CI, 17%-27%),patient navigation (RR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.64-2.46; RD, 18%; 95% CI, 13%-23%),patient education (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06-1.36; RD, 4%; 95% CI, 1%-6%), patientreminders (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41; RD, 3%; 95% CI, 0%-5%), clinicianinterventions of academic detailing (RD, 10%; 95% CI, 3%-17%), and clinicianreminders (RD, 13%; 95% CI, 8%-19%). Combinations of interventions (clinicianinterventions or navigation added to FBT outreach) were associated with greaterincreases than single components (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.29; RD, 7%; 95% CI,3%-11%). Repeated mailed FBTs with navigation were associated with increasedannual FBT completion (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.91-2.29; RD, 39%; 95% CI, 29%-49%).Patient navigation was not associated with colonoscopy completion after aninitial abnormal screening test result (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.92-1.60; RD, 14%; 95%CI, 0%-29%).Conclusions and Relevance: Fecal blood test outreach and patient navigation,particularly in the context of multicomponent interventions, were associated withincreased CRC screening rates in US trials. Fecal blood test outreach should beincorporated into population-based screening programs. More research is needed oninterventions to increase adherence to continued FBTs, follow-up of abnormalinitial screening test results, and cost-effectiveness and other implementationbarriers for more intensive interventions, such as navigation.
