Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly lethal cancer of the lining ofthe chest cavity. To expand our understanding of MPM, we conducted acomprehensive integrated genomic study, including the most detailed analysis ofBAP1 alterations to date. We identified histology-independent molecularprognostic subsets, and defined a novel genomic subtype with TP53 and SETDB1mutations and extensive loss of heterozygosity. We also report strong expressionof the immune checkpoint gene VISTA in epithelioid MPM, strikingly higher than inother solid cancers, with implications for the immune response to MPM and for itsimmunotherapy. Our findings highlight new avenues for further investigation ofMPM biology and novel therapeutic options.
