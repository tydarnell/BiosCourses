Benign cystic epithelial inclusions with squamous, glandular, or MÃ¼llerianphenotypes are known to occur in the axillary lymph nodes of patients with benignand malignant breast disease. Careful evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin-stainedslides and correlation with the histologic findings in the ipsilateral breast areparamount in evaluation of suspected benign inclusions. In this case of ductalcarcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast in a 73-year-old woman, DCIS also involvedepithelial inclusions in an ipsilateral axillary lymph node. The recognition ofthese benign epithelial elements, and awareness that they can be involved byDCIS, is crucial to avoid the overdiagnosis of metastatic carcinoma.
