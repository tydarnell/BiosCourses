The TAM (TYRO-3, AXL, MERTK) family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play animportant role in promoting growth, survival, and metastatic spread of severaltumor types. AXL and MERTK are overexpressed in head and neck squamous cellcarcinoma (HNSCC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC), malignancies that are highly metastatic and lethal. AXL is themost well-characterized TAM receptor and mediates resistance to both conventionaland targeted cancer therapies. Since AXL is highly expressed in aggressive tumortypes, cancer patients are currently being enrolled in clinical trials testingAXL inhibitors. In the current study, we analyzed the effects of AXL inhibitionusing a small molecule AXL inhibitor, monoclonal antibody therapy, and siRNA inHNSCC, TNBC, and NSCLC preclinical models. Anti-AXL targeting strategies hadlimited efficacy across these different models which our data suggests could beattributed to upregulation of MERTK. MERTK expression was increased in cell linesand patient-derived xenografts treated with AXL inhibitors and inhibition ofMERTK sensitized HNSCC, TNBC, and NSCLC preclinical models to AXL inhibition.Dual targeting of AXL and MERTK led to a more potent blockade of downstreamsignaling, synergistic inhibition of tumor cell expansion in culture, and reducedtumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of MERTK in AXLinhibitor-sensitive models resulted in resistance to AXL-targeting strategies.These observations suggest that therapeutic strategies co-targeting both AXL andMERTK could be highly beneficial in a variety of tumor types where both receptorsare expressed, leading to improved survival for patients with lethalmalignancies.
