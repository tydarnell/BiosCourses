Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation therapy is the currentstandard of care for early stage breast cancer. Successful BCS necessitatescomplete tumor resection with clear margins at the pathologic assessment of thespecimen ("no ink on tumor"). The presence of positive margins warrantsadditional surgery to obtain negative final margins, which has significantphysical, psychological, and financial implications for the patient. Thechallenge lies in developing accurate real-time intraoperative margin assessmenttechniques to minimize the presence of "ink on tumor" and the subsequent need foradditional surgery.
