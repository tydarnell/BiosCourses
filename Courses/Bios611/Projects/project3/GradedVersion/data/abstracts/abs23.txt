BACKGROUND: Recreational physical activity has been consistently associated withreduced breast cancer risk. Less is known about how family history of breastcancer impacts the association, and whether it varies by menopausal status.METHODS: The Sister Study is a cohort of 50,884 women who had a sister withbreast cancer, but no prior breast cancer themselves. Women reported allrecreational sport/exercise activities they participated in over the past 12months. Hours/week and MET-hours/week of physical activity were considered inassociation with breast cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidenceintervals (CIs) were calculated with Cox regression. Extent of family history,examined as a modifier, was characterized by a Bayesian score incorporatingcharacteristics of the family structure.RESULTS: During follow-up (average 8.4 years), 3,023 cases were diagnosed. Higherhours/week (HR>=7vs<1=0.77; 95%CI: 0.66-0.90) and MET-hours/week(HRquartile4vs1=0.75; 95%CI: 0.67-0.85) of physical activity were associated withreduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Hours/week and MET-hours/week wereassociated with suggestive increased premenopausal breast cancer risk(MET-hours/week HRquartile4vs1=1.25; 95%CI: 0.98-1.60). Associations did not varywith extent of family history. However, the increased risk in premenopausal womenmay be limited to those with stronger family history.CONCLUSIONS: In women with a family history of breast cancer, physical activitywas associated with reduced postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, breast cancerrisk and was not modified by extent of family history.IMPACT: This was the first study to examine the association between physicalactivity and breast cancer risk in a large population with a family history ofbreast cancer.
