The US Food and Drug Administration and the Critical Path Institute'sPatient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium convened a cosponsored workshop on theuse of PRO measures to inform the assessment of safety and tolerability in cancerclinical trials. A broad array of international stakeholders involved in oncologydrug development and PRO measurement science provided perspectives on the role ofPRO measures to provide complementary clinical data on the symptomatic sideeffects of anticancer agents. Speakers and panelists explored the utility ofinformation derived from existing and emerging PRO measures, focusing on the PROversion of the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria forAdverse Events. Panelists and speakers discussed potential ways to improve thecollection, analysis, and presentation of PRO data describing symptomatic adverseevents to support drug development and better inform regulatory and treatmentdecisions. Workshop participants concluded the day with a discussion of possibleapproaches to the patient-reported assessment of an investigational drug'soverall side effect burden as a potential clinical trial end point. The Food andDrug Administration reiterated its commitment to collaborate with internationaldrug development stakeholders to identify rigorous methods to incorporate thepatient perspective into the development of cancer therapeutics.
