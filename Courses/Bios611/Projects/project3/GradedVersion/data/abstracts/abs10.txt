OBJECTIVE: To examine intravesical chemotherapy (IVC) use according to non-muscleinvasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patient disease risk, and the contributions ofmulti-level factors to variation in proficient use among patients withlow-intermediate disease.METHODS: This study included 988 patients diagnosed with NMIBC in an integratedhealth system in Northern California from 2015-2017. We calculated IVC receipt bydisease risk, and among patients with low-intermediate risk disease, assessed therelationship between multi-level factors and IVC receipt using a logisticregression model with random intercepts for provider and service area, andpatient-, provider-, and service area-level fixed effects. We further assessedthe association of provider- and service area-level factors with IVC use byexamining intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs).RESULTS: Similar proportions of low-intermediate (36%) and high-risk (34%)patients received IVC. In the multivariate analysis including low-intermediaterisk patients, service area volume was strongly and statistically significantlyassociated with IVC use (aOR, high- v. low-volume: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.58).Provider- and service area-level ICCs were large, (38%, p=0.0009 and 39% p=0.03,respectively) indicating that much of the variance in IVC use was explained byfactors at these levels.CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight opportunities to improve proficient use ofIVC. Future research should assess provider- and practice-level barriers to IVCuse among low-intermediate risk patients.
