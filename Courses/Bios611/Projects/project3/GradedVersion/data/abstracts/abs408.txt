BACKGROUND: Oncolytic viruses are genetically engineered or naturally occurringviruses that selectively replicate in cancer cells without harming normal cells.Talimogene laherparepvec (ImlygicÂ®), the first oncolytic viral therapy approvedfor treatment of cancer, was approved for treatment of locally advanced melanomain October 2015.PURPOSE: As a biologic product, use of T. laherparepvec in the clinical settingrequires pretreatment planning and a unique systematic approach to deliver thetherapy. The processes we describe herein could be adopted by other centers thatchoose to prescribe T. laherparepvec.METHODS: We studied our clinical trial experience with T. laherparepvec before weembarked on using commercially available T. laherparepvec. We created a standardoperating procedure (SOP) with multidisciplinary buy-in and oversight fromleadership in Infection Control at our institution. We reflected on clinicalcases and the actual procedures of administering T. laherparepvec to create theSOP.RESULTS: The preimplementation planning, patient selection, identification oflesions to treat, the actual procedure, and ongoing assessment of patients aredescribed. Tumoral-related factors that lead to unique challenges are described.CONCLUSIONS: A process to ensure safe and responsible implementation of a programto administer T. laherparepvec for treatment of melanoma may improve the qualityof treatment for patients who suffer from advanced melanoma.
