OBJECTIVE: To determine the disease-free survival (DFS) and recurrence after thetreatment of patients with rectal cancer with open (OPEN) or laparoscopic (LAP)resection.BACKGROUND: This randomized clinical trial (ACOSOG [Alliance] Z6051), performedbetween 2008 and 2013, compared LAP and OPEN resection of stage II/III rectalcancer, within 12â€Šcm of the anal verge (T1-3, N0-2, M0) in patients who receivedneoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The rectum and mesorectum were resected using openinstruments for rectal dissection (included hybrid hand-assisted laparoscopic) orwith laparoscopic instruments under pneumoperitoneum. The 2-year DFS andrecurrence were secondary endpoints of Z6051.METHODS: The DFS and recurrence were not powered, and are being assessed forsuperiority. Recurrence was determined at 3, 6, 9, 12, and every 6 monthsthereafter, using carcinoembryonic antigen, physical examination, computedtomography, and colonoscopy. In all, 486 patients were randomized to LAP (243) orOPEN (243), with 462 eligible for analysis (LAP = 240 and OPEN = 222). Medianfollow-up is 47.9 months.RESULTS: The 2-year DFS was LAP 79.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 74.4-84.9)and OPEN 83.2% (95% CI 78.3-88.3). Local and regional recurrence was 4.6% LAP and4.5% OPEN. Distant recurrence was 14.6% LAP and 16.7% OPEN.Disease-free survivalwas impacted by unsuccessful resection (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95% CI1.21-2.91): composite of incomplete specimen (HR 1.65, 95% CI 0.85-3.18);positive circumferential resection margins (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.40-3.79); positivedistal margin (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.30-3.77).CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic assisted resection of rectal cancer was not found to besignificantly different to OPEN resection of rectal cancer based on the outcomesof DFS and recurrence.
