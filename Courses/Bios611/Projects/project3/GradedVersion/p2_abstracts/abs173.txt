Understanding how p53 activates certain gene programs and not others is critical.Here, we identify low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), atransmembrane endocytic receptor, as a p53 target gene. We show that, althoughLRP1 transcript expression is upregulated in response to both sub-lethal andlethal doses of p53-activating stress, LRP1 protein is only upregulated inresponse to sub-lethal stress. Interestingly, lethal doses of p53-activatingstress inhibit LRP1 de novo translation through an miRNA-based translationalrepression mechanism. We show that the p53-regulated miRNAs miR-103 and miR-107are significantly upregulated by lethal doses of stress, resulting in suppressionof LRP1 translation and cell death. Our results define a negative feedback loopinvolving the p53-regulated coding gene LRP1 and p53-regulated miRNA genes. Thesefindings provide mechanistic insight into the selective expression of p53 targetgenes in response to different stress intensities to elicit either cell survivalor cell death.
