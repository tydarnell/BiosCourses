The SIU (Société Internationale d'Urologie)-ICUD (International Consultation onUrologic Diseases) working group on systemic therapy for metastatic bladdercancer has summarized the most recent findings on the aforementioned topic andcame to conclusions and recommendations according to the evidence published. InEurope and the United States, treatment for metastatic UC has changed a greatdeal recently, mainly involving a move from chemotherapy to immune checkpointblockers. This is particularly true in platinum-refractory disease, wheresupportive randomized data exist. Five checkpoint blockers have been approved inthis setting by the FDA: avelumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, andpembrolizumab. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab have been approved inEurope.
