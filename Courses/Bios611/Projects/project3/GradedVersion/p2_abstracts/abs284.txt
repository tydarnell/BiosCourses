Although great success has been obtained inÂ the clinic, the current immunecheckpoint inhibitors still face two challenging problems: low response rate andimmune-related adverse effects (irAEs). Here we report the combination ofimmunogenic chemotherapy and locally expressed PD-L1 trap fusion protein forefficacious and safe cancer immunotherapy. We demonstrate that oxaliplatin (OxP)boosts anti-PD-L1 mAb therapy against murine colorectal cancer. By design of aPD-L1 trap and loading its coding plasmid DNA into a lipid-protamine-DNAnanoparticle, PD-L1 trap is produced transiently and locally in the tumormicroenvironment, and synergizes with OxP for tumor inhibition. Significantly,unlike the combination of OxP and anti-PD-L1 mAb, the combination of OxP andPD-L1 trap does not induce obvious Th17 cells accumulation in the spleen,indicating better tolerance and lower tendency to irAEs. The reports here mayhighlight the potential of applying PD-L1 inhibitor, especially locally expressedPD-L1 trap, in cancer therapy following OxP-based chemotherapy.
