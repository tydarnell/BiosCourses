BACKGROUND & AIMS: Estimates of disease burden can inform national healthpriorities for research, clinical care, and policy. We aimed to estimate healthcare use and spending among gastrointestinal (GI) (including luminal, liver, andpancreatic) diseases in the United States.METHODS: We estimated health care use and spending based on the most currentlyavailable administrative claims from commercial and Medicare Supplemental plans,data from the GI Quality Improvement Consortium Registry, and national databases.RESULTS: In 2015, annual health care expenditures for gastrointestinal diseasestotaled $135.9 billion. Hepatitis ($23.3 billion), esophageal disorders ($18.1billion), biliary tract disease ($10.3 billion), abdominal pain ($10.2 billion),and inflammatory bowel disease ($7.2 billion) were the most expensive. Yearly,there were more than 54.4 million ambulatory visits with a primary diagnosis fora GI disease, 3.0 million hospital admissions, and 540,500 all-cause 30-dayreadmissions. There were 266,600 new cases of GI cancers diagnosed and 144,300cancer deaths. Each year, there were 97,700 deaths from non-malignant GIdiseases. An estimated 11.0 million colonoscopies, 6.1 million upper endoscopies,313,000 flexible sigmoidoscopies, 178,400 upper endoscopic ultrasoundexaminations, and 169,500 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographyprocedures were performed annually. Among average-risk persons ages 50-75 yearswho underwent colonoscopy, 34.6% had 1 or more adenomatous polyps, 4.7% had 1 ormore advanced adenomatous polyps, and 5.7% had 1 or more serrated polyps removed.CONCLUSIONS: GI diseases contribute substantially to health care use in theUnited States. Total expenditures for GI diseases are $135.9 billion dollarsannually-greater than for other common diseases. Expenditures are likely tocontinue increasing.
