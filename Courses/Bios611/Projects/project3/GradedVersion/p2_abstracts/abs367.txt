INTRODUCTION: Faith-based organizations can contribute to improving populationhealth, but few dissemination and implementation studies exist. This paperreports countywide adoption, reach, and effectiveness from the Faith, Activity,and Nutrition dissemination and implementation study.DESIGN: This was a group-randomized trial. Data were collected in 2016.Statistical analyses were conducted in 2017.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Churches in a rural, medically underserved county in SouthCarolina were invited to enroll, and attendees of enrolled churches were invitedto complete questionnaires (n=1,308 participated).INTERVENTION: Churches (n=59) were randomized to an intervention or control(delayed intervention) condition. Church committees attended training focused oncreating opportunities, setting guidelines/policies, sharing messages, andengaging pastors for physical activity (PA) and healthy eating (HE). Churchesalso received 12 months of telephone-based technical assistance. Community healthadvisors provided the training and technical assistance.MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption,Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework guided measurement of adoption andreach. To assess effectiveness, church attendees completed post-test onlyquestionnaires of perceptions of church environment, PA and fruit and vegetable(FV) self-efficacy, FV intake, and PA. Regression models controlled for churchclustering and predominant race of congregation, as well as member age, gender,education, and self-reported cancer diagnosis.RESULTS: Church adoption was 42% (55/132). Estimated reach was 3,527,representing 42% of regular church attendees and 15% of county residents.Intervention church attendees reported greater church-level PA opportunities, PAand HE messages, and PA and HE pastor support (p<0.0001), but not FVopportunities (p=0.07). PA self-efficacy (p=0.07) and FV self-efficacy (p=0.21)were not significantly higher in attendees of intervention versus controlchurches. The proportion of inactive attendees was lower in intervention versuscontrol churches (p=0.02). The proportion meeting FV (p=0.27) and PA guidelines(p=0.32) did not differ by group.CONCLUSIONS: This innovative dissemination and implementation study had highadoption and reach with favorable environmental impacts, positioning it forbroader dissemination.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.govNCT02868866.
