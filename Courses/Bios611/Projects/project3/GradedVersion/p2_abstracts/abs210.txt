Purpose: Response to a complex trastuzumab-based regimen is affected by multiplefeatures of the tumor and its microenvironment. Developing a predictive algorithmis key to optimizing HER2-targeting therapy.Experimental Design: We analyzed 137pretreatment tumors with mRNA-seq and DNA exome sequencing from CALGB 40601, aneoadjuvant phase III trial of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab with or withoutlapatinib in stage II to III HER2-positive breast cancer. We adopted an ElasticNet regularized regression approach that controls for covarying features withinhigh-dimensional data. First, we applied 517 known gene expression signatures todevelop an Elastic Net model to predict pCR, which we validated on 143 samplesfrom four independent trials. Next, we performed integrative analysesincorporating clinicopathologic information with somatic mutation status, DNAcopy number alterations (CNA), and gene signatures.Results: The Elastic Net modelusing only gene signatures predicted pCR in the validation sets (AUC = 0.76).Integrative analyses showed that models containing gene signatures, clinicalfeatures, and DNA information were better pCR predictors than models containing asingle data type. Frequently selected variables from the multiplatform modelsincluded amplifications of chromosome 6p, TP53 mutation, HER2-enriched subtype,and immune signatures. Variables predicting resistance included Luminal/ER+features.Conclusions: Models using RNA only, as well as integrated RNA and DNAmodels, can predict pCR with improved accuracy over clinical variables. SomaticDNA alterations (mutation, CNAs), tumor molecular subtype (HER2E, Luminal), andthe microenvironment (immune cells) were independent predictors of response totrastuzumab and paclitaxel-based regimens. This highlights the complexity ofpredicting response in HER2-positive breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 1-13. ©2018AACR.
