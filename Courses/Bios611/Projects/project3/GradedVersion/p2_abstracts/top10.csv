"Baylor College of Medicine",18,"the clinical genome resource (clingen) is supported by the national institutes ofhealth (nih) to develop expertly curated and freely accessible resources definingthe clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine andresearch. to facilitate expert input, clingen has formed clinical domain workinggroups (cdwgs) to leverage the collective knowledge of clinicians, laboratorydiagnosticians, and researchers. in the initial phase of clingen, cdwgs werelaunched in the cardiovascular, hereditary cancer, and inborn errors ofmetabolism clinical fields. these early cdwgs established the infrastructurenecessary to implement standardized processes developed or adopted by clingenworking groups for the interpretation of gene-disease associations and variantpathogenicity, and provided a sustainable model for the formation of futuredisease-focused curation groups. the establishment of cdwgs requires recruitmentof international experts to broadly represent the interests of their field andensure that assertions made are reliable and widely accepted. building on thesuccesses, challenges, and trade-offs made in establishing the original cdwgs,clingen has developed standard operating procedures for the development of cdwgsin new clinical domains, while maximizing efforts to scale up curation andfacilitate involvement of external groups who wish to utilize clingen methods andinfrastructure for expert curation."
"Baylor College of Medicine",18,"melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer in the united states with anincreasing incidence. melanoma lesions often exhibit high immunogenicity, withinfiltrating immune cells playing important roles in regression of tumorsoccurring spontaneously or caused by therapeutic treatment. computational andexperimental methods have been used to estimate the abundance of immune cells intumors, but their applications are limited by the requirement of large gene setsor multiple antibodies. although the prognostic role of immune cells has beenappreciated, a systematic investigation of their association with clinicalfactors, genomic features, prognosis and treatment response in melanoma is stilllacking. this study, identifies a 25-gene signature based on rna-seq data fromthe cancer genome atlas (tcga)-skin cutaneous melanoma (tcga-skcm) dataset. thissignature was used to calculate sample-specific leukocyte infiltration scores(lis) in six independent melanoma microarray datasets and scores were found tovary substantially between different melanoma lesion sites and molecularsubtypes. for metastatic melanoma, lis was prognostic in all datasets with highlis being associated with good survival. the current approach provided additionalprognostic information over established clinical factors, including age, tumorstage, and gender. in addition, lis was predictive of patient survival in stageiii melanoma, and treatment efficacy of tumor-specific antigenvaccine.implications: this study identifies a 25-gene signature that effectivelyestimates the level of immune cell infiltration in melanoma, which provides arobust biomarker for predicting patient prognosis. mol cancer res; 1-11. â©2018aacr."

"Baylor College of Medicine",18,"cooperativity between wnt and fgf signaling is well documented in embryonicdevelopment and cancer progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying thiscross-talk remain elusive. in this study, we interrogated the dynamics of rnalevels, ribosome occupancy, and protein expression as a function of inducible fgfsignaling in mouse mammary glands with constitutive wnt hyperactivation.multiomics correlation analysis revealed a substantial discrepancy between rnaand ribosome occupancy levels versus protein levels. however, this discrepancydecreased as cells became premalignant and dynamically responded to fgfsignaling, implicating the importance of stringent gene regulation innontransformed cells. analysis of individual genes demonstrated that acute fgfhyperactivation increased translation of many stem cell self-renewal regulators,including wnt signaling components, and decreased translation of genes regulatingcellular senescence. wnt pathway components translationally upregulated by fgfsignaling had long and structured 5' utrs with a high frequency of polypurinesequences, several of which harbored (cgg)4 motifs that can fold into eitherstable g-quadruplexes or other stable secondary structures. the fgf-mediatedincrease in translation of wnt pathway components was compromised by silvestrol,an inhibitor of eif4a that clamps eif4a to polypurine sequences to block 43sscanning and inhibits its rna-unwinding activity important for translationinitiation. moreover, silvestrol treatment significantly delayed fgf-wnt-driventumorigenesis. taken together, these results suggest that fgf signalingselectively enhances translation of structured mrnas, particularly wnt signalingcomponents, and highlight their vulnerability to inhibitors that target the rnahelicase eif4a.significance: the rna helicase eif4a may serve as a therapeutictarget for breast cancers that require fgf and wnt signaling. cancer res; 78(15);4229-40. â©2018 aacr."

"Baylor College of Medicine",18,"the clingen pten expert panel was organized by the clingen hereditary cancerclinical domain working group to assemble clinicians, researchers, and moleculardiagnosticians with pten expertise to develop specifications to the 2015 acmg/ampsequence variant interpretation guidelines for pten variant interpretation. wedescribe finalized pten-specific variant classification criteria and outcomesfrom pilot testing of 42 variants with benign/likely benign (ben/lben),pathogenic/likely pathogenic (path/lpath), uncertain significance (vus), andconflicting (conf) clinvar assertions. utilizing these rules, classificationsconcordant with clinvar assertions were achieved for 14/15 (93.3%) ben/lben and16/16 (100%) path/lpath clinvar consensus variants for an overall concordance of96.8% (30/31). the variant where agreement was not reached was a synonymousvariant near a splice donor with noncanonical sequence for which in silico modelscannot predict the native site. applying these rules to six vus and five confvariants, adding shared internal laboratory data enabled one vus to be classifiedas lben and two conf variants to be as classified as path and lpath. this studyhighlights the benefit of gene-specific criteria and the value of sharinginternal laboratory data for variant interpretation. our pten-specific criteriaand expertly reviewed assertions should prove helpful for laboratories and otherscurating pten variants."
"Baylor College of Medicine",18,"context: management of bladder cancer (bc) is primarily driven by stage, grade,and biological potential. knowledge of each is derived using clinical,histopathological, and radiological investigations. this multimodal approachreduces the risk of error from one particular test, but may present a stagingdilemma when results conflict. multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpmri)may improve patient care through imaging of the bladder with better resolution ofthe tissue planes than computed tomography and without radiation exposure.objective: to define a standardized approach to imaging and reporting mpmri forbc, by developing a vi-rads score.evidence acquisition: we created vi-rads (vesical imaging-reporting and datasystem) through consensus using existing literature.evidence synthesis: we describe standard imaging protocols and reporting criteria(including size, location, multiplicity, and morphology) for bladder mpmri. wepropose a five-point vi-rads score, derived using t2-weighted mri,diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast enhancement, which suggests therisks of muscle invasion. we include sample images used to understand vi-rads.conclusions: we hope that vi-rads will standardize reporting, facilitatecomparisons between patients, and in future years, will be tested and refined ifnecessary. while we do not advocate mpmri for all patients with bc, this imagingmay compliment pathology or reduce radiation-based imaging. bladder mpmri may bemost useful in patients with non-muscle-invasive cancers, in expediting radicaltreatment or for determining response to bladder-sparing approaches.patient summary: magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans for bladder cancer arebecoming more common and may provide accurate information that helps improvepatient care. here, we describe a standardized reporting criterion for bladdermri. this should improve communication between doctors and allow bettercomparisons between patients."
"Baylor College of Medicine",18,"the variant curation guidelines published in 2015 by the american college ofmedical genetics and genomics and the association for molecular pathology(acmg/amp) provided the genetics community with a framework to assess variantpathogenicity; however, these rules are not gene specific. germline pathogenicvariants in the cdh1 gene cause hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and lobularbreast cancer, a clinically challenging cancer predisposition syndrome that oftenrequires a multidisciplinary team of experts to be properly managed. given thischallenge, the clinical genome resource (clingen) hereditary cancer domainprioritized the development of the cdh1 variant curation expert panel (vcep) todevelop and implement rules for cdh1 variant classifications. here, we describethe cdh1 specifications of the acmg/amp guidelines, which were developed andvalidated after a systematic evaluation of variants obtained from a cohort ofclinical laboratory data encompassing âˆ¼827,000 cdh1 sequenced alleles. comparingpreviously reported germline variants that were classified using the 2015acmg/amp guidelines to the cdh1 vcep recommendations resulted in reduced variantsof uncertain significance and facilitated resolution of variants with conflictedassertions in clinvar. the clingen cdh1 vcep recommends the use of thesecdh1-specific guidelines for the assessment and classification of variantsidentified in this clinically actionable gene."
"Baylor College of Medicine",18,"in its landmark paper about standards and guidelines for the interpretation ofsequence variants, the american college of medical genetics and genomics (acmg),and association for molecular pathology (amp) did not address how to use tumordata when assessing the pathogenicity of germline variants. the clinical genomeresource (clingen) established a multidisciplinary working group, thegermline/somatic variant subcommittee (gsvs) with this focus. the gsvsimplemented a survey to determine current practices of integrating somatic datawhen classifying germline variants in cancer predisposition genes. the gsvs thenreviewed and analyzed available resources of relevant somatic data, and performedintegrative germline variant curation exercises. the committee determined thatsomatic hotspots could be systematically integrated into moderate evidence ofpathogenicity (pm1). tumor rna sequencing data showing altered splicing may beconsidered as strong evidence in support of germline pathogenicity (pvs1) andtumor phenotypic features such as mutational signatures be considered supportingevidence of pathogenicity (pp4). however, at present, somatic data such as focalloss of heterozygosity and mutations occurring on the alternative allele are notrecommended to be systematically integrated, instead, incorporation of this typeof data should take place under the advisement of multidisciplinary cancer centertumor-normal sequencing boards."

"Brigham and Women's Hospital",11,"polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification thatgoverns protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinctpolyubiquitin linkages ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). weexplored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. usingin vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitinchains with the lys63 (k63) linkage bound to dna through a motif we called the""dna-interacting patch"" (dip), which is composed of the adjacent residues thr9,lys11, and glu34 upon dna damage, the binding of k63-linked polyubiquitin chainsto dna enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction withan ile44 patch in ubiquitin to facilitate dna repair. furthermore, experimentalor cancer patient-derived mutations within the dip impaired the dna bindingcapacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated k63-linked polyubiquitin chainaccumulation at sites of dna damage, thereby resulting in defective dna repairand increased cellular sensitivity to dna-damaging agents. our results thereforehighlight a critical physiological role for k63-linked polyubiquitin chains inbinding to dna to facilitate dna damage repair."

"Duke University",19,"introduction: time-to-treatment-failure (ttf) is the interval from chemotherapyinitiation to premature discontinuation. we evaluated ttf based on age.methods: pooled analyses were conducted with first-line chemotherapy trials foradvanced nsclc (calgb 9730, 30203, and 30801). comparisons among patients whowere 65 years and older and 70 years and older were performed for ttf (primaryendpoint), reasons for early chemotherapy cessation, grade 3+ adverse events, andoverall survival.results: among 1006 patients, 460 (46%) were older than 65 years of age. onehundred forty-five older patients (32% of this age cohort) completed all sixplanned chemotherapy cycles as did 170 (32%) younger patients. median ttf was 2.9months (95% confidence interval: 2.7- 3.2) in older patients and 3 months (95%confidence interval: 2.9-3.5) in younger patients; adjustment for performancestatus and stratification by chemotherapy by trial yielded no statisticallysignificant age-based difference in ttf. however, reasons for early chemotherapycessation differed between age groups (multivariate pâ = 0.004). older patientswere less likely to discontinue from cancer progression (41% versus 55%) and morelikely from toxicity or patient choice (16% and 15%, respectively) compared toyounger patients (13% and 6%, respectively). older patients were more likely toexperience grade 3+ adverse events (86% versus 79%) with no statisticallysignificant difference in survival. an age cutpoint of 70+ years showed nodifference in ttf, a lower trend of early cessation due to cancer progression,and somewhat shorter older patient survival.conclusions: ttf was comparable between older and younger patients; butdifferent, age-based, and potentially modifiable reasons account for it."
"Duke University",19,"purpose: we aimed to examine the effects of multivalent binding and biomimeticcell rolling on the sensitivity and specificity of circulating tumor cell (ctc)capture. we also investigated the clinical significance of ctcs and their kineticprofiles in patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment.experimentaldesign: patients with histologically confirmed primary carcinoma undergoingradiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, were eligible for enrollment.peripheral blood was collected prospectively at up to five time points, includingbefore radiotherapy, at the first week, mid-point and final week of treatment, aswell as 4 to 12 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. ctc capture wasaccomplished using a nanotechnology-based assay (capiocyte) functionalized withaepcam, aher-2, and aegfr.results: capiocyte was able to detect ctcs in all 24cancer patients enrolled. multivalent binding via poly(amidoamine) dendrimersfurther improved capture sensitivity. we also showed that cell rolling effect canimprove ctc capture specificity (% of captured cells that are ck+/cd45-/dapi+) upto 38%. among the 18 patients with sequential ctc measurements, the median ctcdecreased from 113 ctcs/ml before radiotherapy to 32 ctcs/ml at completion ofradiotherapy (p = 0.001). ctcs declined throughout radiotherapy in patients withcomplete clinical and/or radiographic response, in contrast with an elevation inctcs at mid or post-radiotherapy in the two patients with known pathologicresidual disease.conclusions: our study demonstrated that multivalent binding andcell rolling can improve the sensitivity and specificity of ctc capture comparedwith multivalent binding alone, allowing reliable monitoring of ctc changesduring and after treatment. clin cancer res; 24(11); 2539-47. â©2018 aacr."
"Duke University",19,"background: epidemiologic evidence for a serum cholesterol-prostate cancer linkis mixed. prostate-specific antigen (psa) is positively correlated withcholesterol, potentially increasing psa-driven biopsy recommendations in men withhigh cholesterol, though biopsy compliance may be lower in men with comorbidconditions. these potential biases may affect psa-driven biopsy rates andsubsequent prostate cancer detection in men with highâ serum cholesterol. ourobjective was to test the association between serum cholesterol and prostatecancer risk in men receiving psa independent, study-mandated prostate biopsies.methods: we conducted a post hoc analysis of data from 4974 non-statin users inreduce, a randomized trial in men with elevated psa and a negative baselinebiopsy. men underwent 2- and 4-year trial-mandated prostate biopsies.associations between baseline serum levels of total cholesterol, low-densitylipoprotein (ldl), high-density lipoprotein (hdl) and prostate cancer risk,overall and by gleason grade (<7 vs. â‰¥7), were examined using multivariablelogistic regression.results: highâ total serum cholesterol was associated with an increased risk ofhigh-grade prostate cancer diagnosis (or per 10â€‰mg/dl 1.05; 95% ci 1.00-1.09;pâ€‰=â€‰0.048), but cholesterol was unrelated to either overall or low-grade prostatecancer risk (p-values >0.185). there was no association between serum ldl andoverall, low- or high-grade prostate cancer risk (p-values >0.137). in contrast,elevated serum hdl was associated with increased risk of both overall (or per10â€‰mg/dl 1.08; 95% ci 1.01-1.16; pâ€‰=â€‰0.033) and high-grade prostate cancer (orper 10â€‰mg/dl 1.14; 95% ci 1.01-1.28; pâ€‰=â€‰0.034).conclusions: in reduce, where all men received psa independent, trial-mandatedbiopsies thus ensuring complete prostate cancer ascertainment, highâ total serumcholesterol and high hdl were associated with increased risk of high-gradeprostate cancer, supporting a cholesterol-prostate cancer link."

"Northwestern University",9,"background: cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality among hiv patientsin the us due to extended life expectancy with access to effective antiretroviraltherapy. low, detectable hiv rna has been studied as a risk factor for adversehealth outcomes, but its clinical impact on cancer risk remains unclear. theobjective of this study was to determine whether hiv rna <1,000 copies/ml sixmonths after starting therapy was associated with 10-year first cancer risk.methods: we followed 7,515 hiv therapy initiators from a us-based multicenterclinical cohort from 1998 to 2014. we used nonparametric multiple imputation toaccount for viral loads that fell below assay detection limits, and categorizedviral loads six months after therapy initiation into four groups: <20, 20-199,200-999, and >999 copies/ml. we calculated estimates of the cumulative incidenceof cancer diagnosis, accounting for death as a competing event. inverseprobability of exposure and censoring weights were used to control forconfounding and differential loss to follow up, respectively.results: crude 10-year first cancer risk in the study sample was 7.03% (95% ci:6.08%, 7.98%), with the highest risk observed among patients with viral loadsbetween 200 and 999 copies/ml six months after art initiation (10.7%). aftercontrolling for baseline confounders, 10-year first cancer risk was 6.90% (95%ci: 5.69%, 8.12%), and was similar across viral load categories.conclusion: overall risk of first cancer was not associated with incomplete viralsuppression; however, cancer remains a significant threat to hiv patients aftertreatment initiation. as more hiv patients gain access to treatment in thecurrent ""treat all"" era, occurrences of incomplete viral suppression will beobserved more frequently in clinical practice, which supports continued study ofthe role of low-level hiv rna on cancer development."

"Roswell Park Cancer Institute",7,"background: trc105 is an igg1 endoglin monoclonal antibody that potentiates vegfinhibitors in preclinical models. we assessed safety, pharmacokinetics, andantitumor activity of trc105 in combination with axitinib in patients withmetastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc).subjects, materials, and methods: heavily pretreated mrcc patients were treatedwith trc105 weekly (8 mg/kg and then 10 mg/kg) in combination with axitinib(initially at 5 mg b.i.d. and then escalated per patient tolerance to a maximumof 10 mg b.i.d.) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using astandard 3 + 3 phase i design.results: eighteen patients (median number of prior therapies = 3) were treated.trc105 dose escalation proceeded to 10 mg/kg weekly without dose-limitingtoxicity. adverse event characteristics of each drug were not increased infrequency or severity when the two drugs were administered concurrently. trc105and axitinib demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity, including partialresponses (pr) by recist in 29% of patients, and median progression-free survival(11.3 months). none of the patients with pr had pr to prior first-line treatment.lower baseline levels of osteopontin and higher baseline levels of tgf-î² receptor3 correlated with overall response rate.conclusion: trc105 at 8 and 10 mg/kg weekly was well tolerated in combinationwith axitinib, with encouraging evidence of activity in patients with mrcc. amulticenter, randomized phase ii trial of trc105 and axitinib has recentlycompleted enrollment (nct01806064).implications for practice: trc105 is a monoclonal antibody to endoglin (cd105), areceptor densely expressed on proliferating endothelial cells and also on renalcancer stem cells that is implicated as a mediator of resistance to inhibitors ofthe vegf pathway. in this phase i trial, trc105 combined safely with axitinib atthe recommended single agent doses of each drug in patients with renal cellcarcinoma. the combination demonstrated durable activity in a vegfinhibitor-refractory population and modulated several angiogenic biomarkers. arandomized phase ii trial testing trc105 in combination with axitinib in clearcell renal cell carcinoma has completed accrual."
"Roswell Park Cancer Institute",7,"background: black women with endometrial cancer are more likely to die from theirdisease compared to white women with endometrial cancer. these survivaldisparities persist even when disproportionately worse tumor characteristicsamong black women are accounted. receipt of less complete adjuvant treatmentamong black endometrial cancer patients could contribute to this disparity.objective: we assessed the hypothesis that black women with endometrial cancerare less likely than their white counterparts to receive adjuvant treatmentwithin subgroups defined by tumor characteristics in the nrg oncology/gynecologyoncology group 210 study.study design: our analysis included 615 black and 4,283 white women withendometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy. women completed a questionnairethat assessed race and endometrial cancer risk factors. tumor characteristicswere available from pathology reports and central review. we categorized women aslow-, intermediate-, or high-risk based on the european society for medicaloncology definition. adjuvant treatment was documented during postoperativevisits and was categorized as no adjuvant treatment (54.3%), radiotherapy only(16.5%), chemotherapy only (15.2%), and radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (14.0%).we used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidenceintervals for multivariable-adjusted associations between race and adjuvanttreatment in the overall study population and stratified by tumor subtype, stage,or european society for medical oncology risk category.results: overall, black women were more likely to have received chemotherapy-only(odds ratio=1.40, 95% confidence interval=1.04-1.86) or radiotherapy pluschemotherapy (odds ratio=2.01, 95% confidence interval=1.54-2.62) compared towhite women in multivariable-adjusted models. no racial difference in receipt ofradiotherapy-only was observed. in tumor subtype-stratified models, black womenhad higher odds of receiving radiotherapy plus chemotherapy than white women whendiagnosed with low-grade endometrioid (odds ratio=2.04, 95% confidenceinterval=1.06-3.93) or serous tumors (odds ratio=1.81, 95% confidenceinterval=1.07-3.08). race was not associated with adjuvant treatment among womendiagnosed with other tumor subtypes. in stage-stratified models we observed noracial differences in receipt of adjuvant treatment. in models stratified byeuropean society for medical oncology risk group, black women with high-riskcancer were more likely to receive radiotherapy plus chemotherapy compared towhite women (odds ratio=1.41, 95% confidence interval=1.03-1.94).conclusion: contrary to our hypothesis we observed higher odds of specificadjuvant treatment regimens among black as compared to white women withinspecific subgroups of endometrial cancer characteristics."
"Roswell Park Cancer Institute",7,"factors influencing melanoma survival include sex, age, clinical stage, lymphnode involvement, as well as breslow thickness, presence of tumor-infiltratinglymphocytes based on histological analysis of primary melanoma, mitotic rate, andulceration. identification of genes whose expression in primary tumors isassociated with these key tumor/patient characteristics can shed light onmolecular mechanisms of melanoma survival. here, we show results from a geneexpression analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary melanomas withextensive clinical annotation. the cancer genome atlas data on primary melanomaswere used for validation of nominally significant associations. we identifiedfive genes that were significantly associated with the presence oftumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the joint analysis after adjustment formultiple testing: il1r2, ppl, pla2g3, rasal1, and sgk2. we also identified twogenes significantly associated with melanoma metastasis to the regional lymphnodes (pik3cg and il2ra), and two genes significantly associated with sex (kdm5cand kdm6a). we found that lef1 was significantly associated with breslowthickness and ccna2 and ube2t with mitosis. rad50 was the gene most significantlyassociated with survival, with a higher level of expression associated with worsesurvival."
"Roswell Park Cancer Institute",7,"background: micrornas (mirnas) regulate gene expression and influence cancer.primary transcripts of mirnas (pri-mirnas) are poorly annotated and little isknown about the role of germline variation in mirna genes and breast cancer (bc).we sought to identify germline mirna variants associated with bc risk and tumorsubtype among african-american (aa) women.methods: under the african american breast cancer epidemiology and risk (amber)consortium, genotyping and imputed data from four studies on bc in aa women werecombined into a final dataset containing 224,188 mirna gene single nucleotidepolymorphisms (snps) for 8350 women: 3663 cases and 4687 controls. the primarymirna sequence was identified for 566 mirna genes expressed in encyclopedia ofdna elements (encode) tier 1 cell types and human pancreatic islets. associationanalysis was conducted using logistic regression for bc status overall and bytumor subtype.results: a novel bc signal was localized to an 8.6-kb region of 17q25.3 by foursnps (rs9913477, rs1428882938, rs28585511, and rs7502931) and remainedstatistically significant after multiple test correction (odds ratio (or) = 1.44,95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.26-1.65; p =â€‰3.15â€‰ã—â€‰10-7; false discovery rate(fdr)â€‰=â€‰0.03). these snps reside in a genomic location that includes both thepredicted primary transcript of the noncoding mirna gene mir3065 and the firstintron of the gene for brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein2 (baiap2). furthermore, mirna-associated snps on chromosomes 1p32.3, 5q32, and3p25.1 were the strongest signals for hormone receptor, luminal versusbasal-like, and her2 enrichment status, respectively. a second phase ofgenotyping (1397â bc cases, 2418 controls) that included two snps in the 8.6-kbregion was used for validation and meta-analysis. while neither rs4969239 norrs9913477 was validated, when meta-analyzed with the original dataset theirassociation with bc remained directionally consistent (or =â€‰1.29, 95% ci =1.16-1.44 (pâ€‰=â€‰4.18â€‰ã—â€‰10-6) and orâ€‰=â€‰1.33, 95% ci = 1.17-1.51 (pâ€‰=â€‰1.6â€‰ã—â€‰10-5),respectively).conclusion: germline genetic variation indicates that mir3065 may play animportant role in bc development and heterogeneity among aa women. furtherinvestigation to determine the potential functional effects of these snps iswarranted. this study contributes to our understanding of bc risk in aa women andhighlights the complexity in evaluating variation in gene-dense regions of thehuman genome."

"University of Southern California",7,"a standard approach to analysis of case-cohort data involves fitting log-linearmodels. we describe how standard statistical software can be used to fit a broadclass of general relative rate models to case-cohort data and derive confidenceintervals. we focus on a case-cohort design in which a roster has been assembledand events ascertained, but additional information needs to be collected onexplanatory variables. the additional information is ascertained just forindividuals who experience the event of interest and for a sample of the cohortmembers enumerated at study entry. one appeal of such a case-cohort design isthat this sample of the cohort may be used to support analyses of severaloutcomes. the ability to fit general relative rate models to case cohort data mayallow an investigator to reduce model misspecification in exposure-responseanalyses, fit models in which some factors have effects that are additive andothers multiplicative, and facilitate estimation of relative excess risk due tointeraction. we address model fitting for simple random sampling designs as wellas stratified designs. data on lung cancer among radon exposed men are used toillustrate these methods."

"University of Washington",14,"background & aims: guidelines recommend endoscopic surveillance of patients withbarrett's esophagus (be) to identify those with dysplasia (a precursor ofcarcinoma) or early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma (eac) who can be treatedendoscopically. however, it is unclear whether surveillance increases survivaltimes of patients with be. we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis toqualitatively and quantitatively examine evidence for the association ofendoscopic surveillance in patients with be with survival and other outcomes.methods: we searched publication databases for studies reporting the effects ofendoscopic surveillance on mortality and other eac-related outcomes. we reviewedrandomized controlled trials, case-control studies, studies comparing patientswith be who received regular surveillance with those who did not receive regularsurveillance, and studies comparing outcomes of patientsâ withsurveillance-detected eac vs symptom-detected eacs. we performed a meta-analysisof surveillance studies to generate summary estimates using a random effectsmodel. the primary aim was to examine the association of be surveillance oneac-related mortality. secondary aims were to examine the association of besurveillance with all-cause mortality and eac stage at time of diagnosis.results: a single case-control study did not show any association betweensurveillance and eac-related mortality. a meta-analysis of 4 cohort studies foundthat lower eac-related and all-cause mortality were associated with regularsurveillance (relative risk, 0.60; 95% ci, 0.50-0.71; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% ci,0.59-0.94). meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies showed lower eac-related andall-cause mortality among patients with surveillance-detected eac vssymptom-detected eac (relative risk, 0.73; 95% ci, 0.57-0.94; hazard ratio, 0.59;95% ci, 0.45-0.76). lead- and length-time bias adjustment substantiallyattenuated/eliminatedâ the observed benefits. surveillance was associated withdetection of eac at earlier stages. a randomized trial is underway to evaluatethe effectsâ of endoscopic surveillance on mortality in patients with be.conclusions: in a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects ofsurveillance in patients with be, surveillance as currently performed wasassociated with detection of earlier-stage eac and may provide a small survivalbenefit. however, the effects of confounding biases on these estimates are notfully defined and may completely or partially explain the observed differencesbetween surveyed and unsurveyed patients."

"Vanderbilt University Medical Center",8,"background: the majority of urothelial cancers (uc) harbor alterations inretinoblastoma (rb) pathway genes that can lead to loss of rb tumour suppressorfunction. palbociclib is an oral, selective inhibitor of cdk 4/6 that restores rbfunction and promotes cell cycle arrest.methods: in this phase ii trial, patients with metastatic platinum-refractory ucmolecularly selected for p16 loss and intact rb by tumour immunohistochemistryreceived palbociclib 125â€‰mg p.o. daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. primaryendpoint was progression-free survival at 4 months (pfs4) using a simon'stwo-stage design. next-generation sequencing including rb pathway alterations wasconducted.results: twelve patients were enrolled and two patients (17%) achieved pfs4 withinsufficient activity to advance to stage 2. no responses were seen. median pfswas 1.9 months (95% ci 1.8-3.7 months) and median overall survival was 6.3 months(95% ci 2.2-12.6 months). fifty-eight percent of patients had grade â‰¥3hematologic toxicity. there were no cdkn2a alterations found and no correlationof rb pathway alterations with clinical outcome.conclusions: palbociclib did not demonstrate meaningful activity in selectedpatients with platinum-refractory metastatic uc. further development ofpalbociclib should only be considered with improved integral biomarker selectionor in rational combination with other therapies."
"Vanderbilt University Medical Center",8,"purpose: male breast cancer (bc) is rare, representing approximately 1% ofcancers that occur in men and approximately 1% of all bcs worldwide. because malebc is rare, not much is known about the disease, and treatment recommendationsare typically extrapolated from data available from clinical trials enrollingfemale bc patients.methods: we review the epidemiology, risk factors, prognosis, and the variedmolecular and clinicopathologic features that characterize male bc. in addition,we summarize the available data for the use of systemic therapy in the treatmentof male bc and explore the ongoing development of targeted therapeutic agents forthe treatment of this subgroup of bcs.results: there are important biological differences between male and female bc.male bc is almost exclusively hormone receptor positive (+), including theandrogen receptor (ar), and is associated with an increased prevalence of brca2germline mutations, especially in men with increased risk for developinghigh-risk bc. additional research is warranted to better characterize male bc. toaccomplish this, a multi-national consortium approach, such as the internationalmale breast cancer program, is needed in response to the scarcity of patients.this approach allows the pooling of information from a large number of men withbc and the creation of registries for future therapeutic-focused clinical trials.conclusions: given the unique biology of bc in men, promising new therapeutictargets are currently under investigation, including the use of poly-adp-ribosepolymerase inhibitors or ar-targeted agents either as monotherapy or incombination with other agents."
