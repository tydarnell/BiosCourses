Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive gastric adenocarcinoma exhibits locally intenseinflammation but systemic manifestations are uncertain. Our study examinedwhether circulating mediators of inflammation and immune response differ by tumorEBV status. From a Latvian series of 302 gastric cancer cases, we measured plasmalevels of 92 immune-related proteins in the 28 patients with EBV-positive tumorsand 34 patients with EBV-negative tumors. Eight markers were statisticallysignificantly higher with tumor EBV positivity: chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL)20 (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.6; p-trend = 0.001), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 9 (OR =3.6; p-trend = 0.003), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; OR = 3.4; p-trend =0.004), interleukin (IL)-10 (OR = 2.4; p-trend = 0.019), CCL19 (OR = 2.3; p-trend= 0.019), CCL11 (OR = 2.2; p-trend = 0.026), IL-17A (OR = 2.0; p-trend = 0.038)and CCL8 (OR = 1.9; p-trend = 0.049). Systemic responses to EBV-positive gastriccancer are characterized by alterations in chemokines and PD-L1. Profiling ofthese molecules may enable non-invasive diagnosis of EBV status when tumor tissueis unavailable. Our findings provide theoretical justification for clinicalevaluations of immune checkpoint therapy for EBV-positive gastric cancer.
