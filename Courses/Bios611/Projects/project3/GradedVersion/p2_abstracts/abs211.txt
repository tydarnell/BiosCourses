Increasing evidence suggests that extracellular miRNAs may serve as biomarkers ofdiseases, but the physiological relevance of extracellular miRNA is unclear. Wefind that intradermal cheek injection of miR-711 induces TRPA1-depedent itch(scratching) without pain (wiping) in naive mice. Extracellular perfusion ofmiR-711 induces TRPA1 currents in both Trpa1-expressing heterologous cells andnative sensory neurons through the core sequence GGGACCC. Computer simulationsreveal that the core sequence binds several residues at the extracellular S5-S6loop of TRPA1, which are critical for TRPA1 activation by miR-711 but not allylisothiocyanate. Intradermal inoculation of human Myla cells induces lymphoma andchronic itch in immune-deficient mice, associated with increased serum levels ofmiR-711, secreted from cancer cells. Lymphoma-induced chronic itch is suppressedby miR-711 inhibitor and a blocking peptide that disrupts the miR-711/TRPA1interaction. Our findings demonstrated an unconventional physiological role ofextracellular naked miRNAs as itch mediators and ion channel modulators.
