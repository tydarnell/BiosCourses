Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare butextremely lethal malignancy that mainly impacts young women. SCCOHT ischaracterized by a diploid genome with loss of SMARCA4 and lack of SMARCA2expression, two mutually exclusive ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelingcomplex. We and others have identified the histone methyltransferase EZH2 as apromising therapeutic target for SCCOHT, suggesting that SCCOHT cells depend onthe alternation of epigenetic pathways for survival. In this study, we found thatSCCOHT cells were more sensitive to pan-HDAC inhibitors compared to other ovariancancer lines or immortalized cell lines tested. Pan-HDAC inhibitors, such asquisinostat, reversed the expression of a group of proteins that were deregulatedin SCCOHT cells due to SMARCA4 loss, leading to growth arrest, apoptosis anddifferentiation in vitro and suppressed tumor growth of xenografted tumors ofSCCOHT cells. Moreover, combined treatment of HDAC inhibitors and EZH2 inhibitorsat sub-lethal doses synergistically induced histone H3K27 acetylation and targetgene expression, leading to rapid induction of apoptosis and growth suppressionof SCCOHT cells and xenografted tumors. Therefore, our preclinical studyhighlighted the therapeutic potential of combined treatment of HDAC inhibitorswith EZH2 catalytic inhibitors to treat SCCOHT.
