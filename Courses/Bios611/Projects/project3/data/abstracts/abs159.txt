Background: We undertook this study to identify patients with Parkinson disease(PD) with no or rare falls who may progress to frequent falling by their nextannual follow-up visit.Methods: We analyzed data in the National Parkinson Foundation QualityImprovement Initiative database to identify factors predicting which patientswith PD with no or rare falls at the baseline visit will report at least monthlyfalls at the annual follow-up visit. Multivariable models were constructed usinglogistic regression. Variables were introduced in 4 blocks: in the 1st block,variables present at or before the baseline visit were entered; in the 2nd,baseline visit assessments; in the 3rd, interventions implemented during baselinevisit; and, in the 4th block, changes in comorbidities, living situation, andtreatment between visits.Results: Of 3,795 eligible participants, 3,276 (86.3%) reported no or rare fallsat baseline visit, and of them, 382 (11.7%) reported at least monthly falls atfollow-up visit. Predictors included female sex, <90% diagnostic certainty, motorfluctuations, levodopa treatment, antidepressant treatment, prior deep brainstimulation (DBS), worse quality of life, Hoehn & Yahr stage 2 or 3, worsesemantic fluency, and, between visits, addition of amantadine, referral tooccupational therapy, social services, or DBS, new diagnoses of cancer orosteoarthritis, and increased emergency visits.Conclusions: This large-scale analysis identified several predictors ofprogression to falling in PD. Such identifiers may help target patient subgroupsfor falls prevention intervention. Some factors are modifiable, offeringopportunities for developing such interventions.
