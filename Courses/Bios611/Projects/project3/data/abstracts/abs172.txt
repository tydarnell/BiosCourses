With more than 150,000 deaths per year in the US alone, lung cancer has thehighest number of deaths for any cancer. These poor outcomes reflect a lack oftreatment for the most common form of lung cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma(NSCLC). Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the most prevalent subtype of NSCLC, withthe main oncogenic drivers being KRAS and epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR). Whereas EGFR blockade has led to some success in lung ADC, effective KRASinhibition is lacking. KRAS-mutant ADCs are characterized by high levels ofgel-forming mucin expression, with the highest mucin levels corresponding toworse prognoses. Despite these well-recognized associations, little is knownabout roles for individual gel-forming mucins in ADC development causatively. Wehypothesized that MUC5AC/Muc5ac, a mucin gene known to be commonly expressed inNSCLC, is crucial in KRAS/Kras-driven lung ADC. We found that MUC5AC was asignificant determinant of poor prognosis, especially in patients withKRAS-mutant tumors. In addition, by using mice with lung ADC induced chemicallywith urethane or transgenically by mutant-Kras expression, we observedsignificantly reduced tumor development in animals lacking Muc5ac compared withcontrols. Collectively, these results provide strong support for MUC5AC as apotential therapeutic target for lung ADC, a disease with few effectivetreatments.
