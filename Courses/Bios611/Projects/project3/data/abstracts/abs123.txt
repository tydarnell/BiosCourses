The increasing incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in younger adults (age <50years) has been widely reported. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology,and End Results Program, we young-onset CRC incidence rates decreased from 1975through about 1990. Decreases were more prominent in the colon, a contrast withmore recent increases in rectal cancer. Incidence rates subsequently increased,differing by time period and 5-year age group. This inflection point isconsistent with a birth cohort effect and points to early life exposures -accumulated throughout the life course - that may increase cancer risk. Studyingearly life exposures among persons born after 1960 may advance our understandingof CRC in younger adults.
