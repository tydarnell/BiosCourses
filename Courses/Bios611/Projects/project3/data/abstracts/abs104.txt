The Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) consortium, now inits second funding cycle, is investigating the effectiveness of integratinggenomic (exome or genome) sequencing into the clinical care of diverse andmedically underserved individuals in a variety of healthcare settings and diseasestates. The consortium comprises a coordinating center, six funded extramuralclinical projects, and an ongoing National Human Genome Research Institute(NHGRI) intramural project. Collectively, these projects aim to enroll andsequence over 6,100 participants in four years. At least 60% of participants willbe of non-European ancestry or from underserved settings, with the goal ofdiversifying the populations that are providing an evidence base for genomicmedicine. Five of the six clinical projects are enrolling pediatric patients withvarious phenotypes. One of these five projects is also enrolling couples whosefetus has a structural anomaly, and the sixth project is enrolling adults at riskfor hereditary cancer. The ongoing NHGRI intramural project has enrolledprimarily healthy adults. Goals of the consortium include assessing the clinicalutility of genomic sequencing, exploring medical follow up and cascade testing ofrelatives, and evaluating patient-provider-laboratory level interactions thatinfluence the use of this technology. The findings from the CSER consortium willoffer patients, healthcare systems, and policymakers a clearer understanding ofthe opportunities and challenges of providing genomic medicine in diversepopulations and settings, and contribute evidence toward developing bestpractices for the delivery of clinically useful and cost-effective genomicsequencing in diverse healthcare settings.
