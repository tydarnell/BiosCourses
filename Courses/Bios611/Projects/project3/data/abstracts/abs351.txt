Combination immunotherapy has recently emerged as a powerful cancer treatmentstrategy. A promising treatment approach utilizes coadministration ofantagonistic antibodies to block checkpoint inhibitor receptors, such asantiprogrammed cell death-1 (aPD1), alongside agonistic antibodies to activatecostimulatory receptors, such as antitumor necrosis factor receptor superfamilymember 4 (aOX40). Optimal T-cell activation is achieved when bothimmunomodulatory agents simultaneously engage T-cells and promote synergisticproactivation signaling. However, standard administration of these therapeuticsas free antibodies results in suboptimal T-cell binding events, with only asubset of the T-cells binding to both aPD1 and aOX40. Here, it is shown thatprecise spatiotemporal codelivery of aPD1 and aOX40 using nanoparticles (NP)(dual immunotherapy nanoparticles, DINP) results in improved T-cell activation,enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and increased immunological memory. It isdemonstrated that DINP elicits higher rates of T-cell activation in vitro thanfree antibodies. Importantly, it is demonstrated in two tumor models thatcombination immunotherapy administered in the form of DINP is more effective thanthe same regimen administered as free antibodies. This work demonstrates a novelstrategy to improve combination immunotherapy using nanotechnology.
